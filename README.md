### What is LaunchpadLights ?
Launchpadlight is a VisualBasic project which aims to use are launchpad with the goal, the simplicity, the little demand of resource.

### What is the document necessary to run the application
LaunchpadLight needs :
* GunaUI 2 Framework
* **Documents of LaunchpadLight** to copy in its "documents" folder
* Microsoft Framework 4.5

### Which launchpad is compatible
For the moment, the **only** compatible Launchpad is the Novation Launchpad MK2 ! We will add more launchpad in the future as well as an automatic assignment function !

### How to make SoundPack
A sound pack contains 2 objects :
- The Title file as well as the artist name
- The sounds of the pack

The title file is in "(nameofpack)/config/title.txt".
Inside, indicate the name of the music reproduced. If the file is missing or misplaced, LaunchpadLight will inform you and replace the title with "(null)".

The artist file can be found in "(nameofpack)/config/artist.txt".
Inside, indicate the name of the artist of the music reproduced. If the file is missing or misplaced, LaunchpadLight will inform you and replace the title with "(null)".

The sounds are contained in the folder "(nameofpack)/sounds/page(numberofpage)/pad(numberofpad)".
The pad number is formed as follows:
(0)(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)
(8)(9)... Continue to 63...
The maximum number of pages is 8.
